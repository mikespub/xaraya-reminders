## Overview

### What is it?

*This module lets you set up automatic emails to remind you (or others)
about events ou have defined.*

The module supports two types of events:

  - Reminders: These are emails that remind one of upcoming events.
    Reminder emails are sent at defined intervals prior to an event.
  - Lookups: These are emails that suggest contacting someone from a
    list of defined contacts. Lookup emails are sent at periodic
    intervals (for instance, daily).

### How to use it?

1.  Set up the scheduler module and define reminders and lookups as jobs
    in that module.
2.  Set up reminder emails.
3.  Set up lookup emails.

### Reminder Emails

Reminder emails remind you of an upcoming event once or several times.

For instance, if you pay monthly parking fees, you can define reminders
one or more days ahead of the due date for the payment, say 7, 3 and 1
days before the due date. Each email lets you disable further reminders
if they are no longer useful (e.g., if you have paid the fee).

### Lookup Emails

Lookup emails are sent periodically, for instance daily. A lookup email
contains the contact details taken from a contact list you define and
suggests you make contact with them.

The contact details suggested are taken randomly from your contact list,
but you can define a minimal interval from one email to the next for
given contact. For instance, you may not want to be reminded to contact
the same person for, say, 3 months.
